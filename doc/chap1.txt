  [33X[0;0YDebugger   is   a   [5XGAP[105X  package  which  advanced  some  advanced  debugging
  functionality  to  GAP.  It  does  not replace GAP's builtin break loop, but
  provides new ways to access the break loop.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  this  chapter we describe a couple of different uses of debugger. First,
  we explain in Section [14X1.1[114X how to set breakpoints.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThen  we  show  in Section [14X1.2[114X how to create a function which will be called
  every before every line of GAP code.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YCreating Breakpoints[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YSuppose  you  want  to  enter  the  break  loop at a particular line of your
  existing  code.  We  can  use  [2XAddBreakpoint[102X  ([14X2.1-1[114X),  which lets you set a
  filename and line to break at. When this line is reached, [5XGAP[105X will enter the
  break loop. For example:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4XAddBreakpoint("mycode.g", 54);[104X
    [4XAddBreakpoint("lib/grp.g", 128);[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YAll  functions  in  the debugger package do not require a full filename, but
  will instead look for filenames which end with the given string. Once in the
  breakloop,   use   [10Xreturn;[110X   to  continue  execution.  At  any  point,  call
  [2XClearAllBreakpoints[102X  ([14X2.1-3[114X)  to  remove  all  breakpoints. Like in standard
  debuggers,  while  in  the break loop we can use the functions [2XBreakNextLine[102X
  ([14X2.1-5[114X),  [2XBreakNextEnterFunction[102X  ([14X2.1-7[114X) and [2XBreakNextLeaveFunction[102X ([14X2.1-9[114X)
  to  re-enter  the break loop at the next line, next time we enter a function
  or  next  time we leave a function. The function [2XBreakEveryLine[102X ([14X2.1-6[114X) will
  make GAP enter the break loop after each line of code is executed.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YCalling Functions[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YInstead  of  entering  the break loop, we can instead call a function when a
  particular  line  is  reached,  or  after  every  line. Each function in the
  debugger  package  optionally  takes  a  function  to  be called, instead of
  entering  the break loop. For example, consider that we want to find exactly
  which part of GAP sets the size of a group [10XG[110X. We can call:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4Xfunc := function(file,line)[104X
    [4X  if HasSize(G) then Error("Size set!"); fi;[104X
    [4Xend;[104X
    [4XBreakEveryLine(func);[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  will call [10Xfunc[110X before every line of GAP code is executed, entering the
  break loop when the size of [10XG[110X is set.[133X
